# IPL Trivia Quiz Website using OpenAI and Langchain

Welcome to the IPL Trivia Quiz website project! This repository contains the code for a simple trivia quiz website about the Indian Premier League (IPL), built using OpenAI's API and Langchain. This project serves as a hands-on exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications.

## Project Overview

**Objective**: To build an interactive trivia quiz website for IPL, leveraging OpenAI's API and Langchain.

**Key Learning Areas**:
- Configuring LLMs
- Designing prompt templates
- Implementing chaining techniques (simple sequential and sequential chains)
- Utilizing memory components in LLMs, including conversation buffer memory and window size
- Developing an interactive interface using the Streamlit Python library

## Features

- **Trivia Quiz**: Engage users with IPL-related trivia questions.
- **LLM Integration**: Utilize OpenAI's API for generating questions and responses.
- **Memory Component**: Leverage conversation buffer memory to maintain context.
- **Interactive Interface**: Rapid development using Streamlit for a seamless user experience.

## Future Enhancements

- Improve the efficiency and accuracy of the trivia questions.
- Enhance the user interface for a better user experience.
- Add more diverse and challenging trivia questions.
- Incorporate feedback mechanisms for users to suggest improvements.
